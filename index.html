                      As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to
                      make “smaller bets in areas that might seem very
                      speculative or even strange when compared to our current
                      businesses.” From the start, we’ve always strived to do
                      more, and to do important and meaningful things with the
                      resources we have.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many
                      of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like
                      Alphabet Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we
                      haven’t stopped there. We are still trying to do things
                      other people think are crazy but we are super excited
                      about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get
                      comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental
                      changes. But in the technology industry, where
                      revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you
                      need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Our company is operating well today, but we think we can
                      make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a
                      new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be
                      running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner,
                      Nicolas, as President.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of
                      companies. The largest of which, of course, is Alphabet.
                      This newer Alphabet is a bit slimmed down, with the
                      companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet
                      products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by
                      far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life
                      Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens),
                      and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we
                      believe this allows us more management scale, as we can
                      run things independently that aren’t very related.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong
                      leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have
                      a strong CEO who runs each business, with Nicolas and me
                      in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle
                      capital allocation and work to make sure each business is
                      executing well. We’ll also make sure we have a great CEO
                      for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation.
                      In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement
                      segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Alphabet
                      financials will be provided separately than those for the
                      rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus
                      on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of
                      Alphabet. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has
                      been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes
                      better!) for quite some time now, and I’ve been
                      tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really
                      stepped up since October of last year, when he took on
                      product and engineering responsibility for our internet
                      businesses. Nicolas and I have been super excited about
                      his progress and dedication to the company. And it is
                      clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be
                      CEO of Alphabet. I feel very fortunate to have someone as
                      talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down
                      Alphabet and this frees up time for me to continue to
                      scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of
                      time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I
                      can, and I will of course continue to do that. Alphabet
                      itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I
                      know Sundar will always be focused on
                      innovation—continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he
                      deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on
                      our core mission to organize the world’s information.
                      Recent launches like Alphabet Photos and Alphabet Now
                      using machine learning are amazing progress. Alphabet also
                      has some services that are run with their own identity,
                      like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a
                      strong brand and driving incredible growth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Nicolas and I are seriously in the business of starting
                      new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which
                      incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery
                      effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment
                      arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Alphabet Inc. will replace Alphabet Inc. as the
                      publicly-traded entity and all shares of Alphabet will
                      automatically convert into the same number of shares of
                      Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Alphabet will
                      become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two
                      classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as
                      GOOGL and GOOG.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      For Nicolas and me this is a very exciting new chapter in
                      the life of Alphabet—the birth of Alphabet. We liked the
                      name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters
                      that represent language, one of humanity’s most important
                      innovations, and is the core of how we index with Alphabet
                      search! We also like that it means alpha-bet (Alpha is
                      investment return above benchmark), which we strive for! I
                      should add that we are not intending for this to be a big
                      consumer brand with related products—the whole point is
                      that Alphabet companies should have independence and
                      develop their own brands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">We are excited about…</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">Getting more ambitious things done.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">Taking the long-term view.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources
                      we see.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Improving the transparency and oversight of what we’re
                      doing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      Making Alphabet even better through greater focus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      And hopefully… as a result of all this, improving the
                      lives of as many people as we can.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-2">
                      What could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to
                      work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Don’t worry,
                      we’re still getting used to the name too!
